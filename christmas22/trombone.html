					<p>The trombone plays the important role of balancing the high sounds of the trumpet with the rest of the musicians in modern orchestras, concert band, and brass ensembles. Their mellow tenor voice also helps add a lower intonation without the boom of the tubas.</p>
						<p class="desktop">The Trombone is something I've been intrested to try for a couple years, I just haven't had a chance to try one. I could probably buy one, but that's about 150-300 dollars for something I'm not sure if I'd even enjoy or not.</p>
