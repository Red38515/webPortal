					<p>Computer RAM(Random Access memory) is a way for a Computer to make quick actions without going into long term memory that it requires to operate. This allows for it to run faster and save more file space. The thing about RAM is that it resets every time the computer is shut down and reboots when it is turned back on. As per most things, the more ram you have the better the computer runs.</p>
